## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

While working on this page, I refreshed my knowledge of pure HTML and CSS. I had to spend more time on the HTML pseudo-element `::marker` when styling `<ul>` and `<ol>` since I hadn't done that before.
